# Dragons of Mugloar solution

A solution to the [Dragons of Mogloar challenge](https://www.dragonsofmugloar.com/) written in Java.

This was one of the most fun looking and well put together coding challenges found online - I strongly recommend it to
anyone looking for a fun and short programming assignment.

The only complaint I have is that the solutions to the "non-normal" weather were a bit too simple.
